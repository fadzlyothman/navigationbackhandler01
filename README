This is a React Native tutorial project to assist people with the following issues:

- Multi Screen Navigation
- Android BackButton Handler
- Hiding of Navigation Bar

This project is catered to run on Android Devices but it should be able to run in Apple devices, though that is never tested.

Should you encountered an error similar to:

'java.io.IOException: Unable to delete directory <your_project_directory>\android\app\build\intermediates\javac\debug\compileDebugJavaWithJavac\classes\android\arch\lifecycle\livedata.
> Unable to delete directory <your_project_directory>\android\app\build\intermediates\javac\debug\compileDebugJavaWithJavac\classes\android\arch\lifecycle\livedata.'

You can try deleting the <your_project_directory>\android\app\build directory and run it again.
